# Challenge 2: Portfolio
## Description
This is a portfolio of my past work. It includes my name, 
a photo of myself, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact
me. Clicking these links takes the user to the corresponding section. In the
section with my work, the user can click on an individual work and be taken
its online location for viewing. This website is responsive and adapts
to different screens resolutions and devices.
